            I'm currently a full-time student at Seneca Polytechnic, where I'm expanding my knowledge in software development and honing my technical skills. 
            Beyond my academic studies, I have a deep passion for web development, particularly in JavaScript, React.js, and backend technologies. 
            I enjoy building dynamic and interactive web applications, constantly exploring new frameworks and best practices to improve my craft. 
            
            In addition to coding, I have a strong interest in gaming, which fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills. 
            I love staying up to date with emerging technologies, experimenting with new tools, and applying them to real-world projects. 
            
            Right now, I'm actively working on an exciting e-commerce project that allows me to integrate my frontend and backend expertise, focusing on performance, scalability, and user experience. 
            This project not only strengthens my development skills but also prepares me for future opportunities in the tech industry.
